# Clean Code

### :pencil: What is "Clean Code"?

Clean code is not about whether code works or not. Instead, it is about
whether code is easy to read and understand, because as developers
we spend quite a lot of time reading code and understanding code.

So clean code should be:

:white_check_mark: Should be readable and meaningful.

:white_check_mark: Should reduce cognitive.

:white_check_mark: Should be concise and "to the point".

:white_check_mark: Should avoid unintuitive names, complex nesting and big code blocks.

:white_check_mark: Should follow common best practices and patterns.

:white_check_mark: Should be fun to write and to maintain.

Always write a good story!
